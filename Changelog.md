# Changelog

## 0.4.3

* SQL Numeric and Decimal are now always mapped to the parquet Decimal independent of the precision or scale. The 32Bit or 62Bit "physical" Integer epresentation is choosen for SQL types with Scale Null and a precision smaller ten or 19, otherwise the "physical" type is to be a fixed size byte array.

## 0.4.2

* Fix: Tool could panic if too many warnings were generated at once.

## 0.4.1

* Introduces subcommand `list-data-sources`.

## 0.4.0

* Introduces subcommands. `query` is now required to `query` the database and store contents into parquet.
* Introduces `drivers` subcommand.

## 0.3.0

* Adds support for parameterized queries.

## 0.2.1

* Fix: A major issue caused columns containing NULL values to either cause a panic or even worse, produce a parquet file with wrong data in the affected column without showing any error at all.

## 0.2.0

* Binary release of 32 Bit Window executable on GitHub
* Binary release for OS-X
* Connection string is no longer a positional argument.
* Allow connecting to an ODBC datasource using dsn.

## 0.1.6

* Binary release of 64 Bit Window executable on GitHub

## 0.1.5

* Maps ODBC `Bit` to Parquet `Boolean`.
* Maps ODBC `Tinyint` to Parquet `INT 8`.
* Maps ODBC `Real` to Parquet `Float`.
* Maps ODBC `Numeric` same as it would `DECIMAL`.

## 0.1.4

* Default row group size is now `100000`.
* Adds support for Decimal types with precision 0..18 and scale = 0 (i.e. Everything that has a straightforward `i32` or `i64` representation).

## 0.1.3

* Fix: Fixed an issue there some column types were not bound to the cursor, which let to some column only containing `NULL` or `0`.

## 0.1.2
